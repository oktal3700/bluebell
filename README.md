This is the git repository for the Bluebell CSL package, a set of
non-flyable aircraft models for multiplayer X-Plane plugins.

It contains just the text files, not any of the texture image files.
Those can be found

The text files are covered by the Creative Commons Zero license.
The texture images are licensed separately and may not be redistributed.

Use the [issues tab](https://github.com/oktal3700/bluebell/issues/new/choose)
to submit new CSL models or liveries to be added to the package.
